# Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a certified Data Scientist with a background in logistics and a passion for solving real-world problems with data.

After completing a 7-month intensive Data Science program at TripleTen, I built 17 hands-on projects, including a customer churn prediction model (0.85 ROC-AUC) and a global video game sales analysis. I work primarily in Python and SQL using tools like Jupyter Notebook, scikit-learn, and pandas—and I love digging into end-to-end projects that involve EDA, machine learning, and data storytelling.

## 🔍 I'm currently exploring:
- New ways to use data for decision-making
- Opportunities to collaborate on real-world ML applications
- Data visualization and interpretability best practices

## 🤝 I'm looking to collaborate on:
- Open-source or portfolio-driven ML projects
- Business-focused data problems
- Projects involving time series or customer analytics

## 💬 Ask me about:
- Python, SQL, and machine learning fundamentals
- My churn and game data projects
- Transitioning into data science from a non-tech background

## ✨ Fun fact:
Before becoming a data scientist, I was managing moves from home to home some clients were major artists like NF and Dan + Shay—and now I move data instead.

Thanks for stopping by!
